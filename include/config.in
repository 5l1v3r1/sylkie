 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the inner workings of the <a href="http://sylkie.io">sylkie</a>
 * command line tool.
 *
 * \section purpose_sec Purpose
 *
 * The documentation here is targeted at developers that are either
 * contributing to the tool, or are looking to do something more complex.
 * Most use cases can be covered by command line programs, but sometimes it
 * is necessary to directly use the shared lib.

 * \section get_started Getting Started
 *
 * \subsection get_code Get the code
 * ```
 * git clone https://github.com/dlrobertson/sylkie
 * cd ./sylkie
 *
 * # Compile the code
 * mkdir -p ./build
 * cd ./build
 * cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
 * make
 * make install
 * ```
 *
 * \subsection run_tests Run the tests
 *
 * Ensure that you ran cmake with the additional argument `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON`.
 *
 * ```
 * make test
 * ```
 *
 * or
 *
 * ```
 * ./sylkie_test
 * ```
 *
 * \subsection build_docs Build the docs
 *
 * Ensure that you ran cmake with the additional argument `-DBUILD_DOCS=ON`,
 * and make sure `doxygen` is installed on your local system. If everything
 * has been set up correctly `make doc` should compile the documentation.
 *
 * \defgroup libsylkie Core public functions and structures
